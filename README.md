### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

* ğŸ¤– I'm currently working on building GenAI systems that actually help editors and researchers (instead of just hyping about AI)
* ğŸ”­ I spend my days figuring out how to make AI work in scholarly publishing workflows at Wiley
* ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning how to properly package and publish Python code (better late than never!)
* ğŸ’¬ Ask me about GenAI in publishing, transitioning from academia to industry, or developing film in your bathroom
* ğŸ“« How to reach me: Drop me a IM on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwflanagan/) or Mastodon ([@dwflanagan@scicomm.xyz](https://scicomm.xyz/@Dwflanagan))
* âš¡ Fun fact: I've met Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking.
