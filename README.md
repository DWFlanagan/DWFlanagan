### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on using data science and machine learning to solve problems in scholarly publishing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use GitHub Actions to automate all the things.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to get started in data science in academic publishing, or in developing film at home.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Drop me an IM on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwflanagan/) or Twitter ([@DWFlanagan](https://twitter.com/DWFlanagan)).
